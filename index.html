      <p>We list links to six interactive explanation visualizations below. The interactive visualizations are composed of two parts: The top figure shows a schematic of all the high density fNIRS channels. Each channel location is color coordinated according to its saliency, darker reds for more salient features, whites for less salient ones. The bottom plot shows which channel was most salient at a given timestep of the input. Again, the squares are color coded with more salient channels appearing darker red and less salient channels closer to white. Move your cursor over the bottom plot to inspect individual timestep schematics and the most salient channel's saliency value at each timestep</p>
